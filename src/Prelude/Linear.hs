-- A note on implementation: to avoid silly mistakes, very easy functions are
-- simply reimplemented here. For harder function, we reuse the Prelude
-- definition and make an unsafe cast.

-- higher-order and we don't have multiplicity polymorphism yet.

-- XXX: Temporary as `($)` should get its typing rule directly from the type
